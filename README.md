Before running the code, make sure that python libraries- networkx and matplotlib are installed in your system.

It can be installed using the following cmd prompts: <br>
1- pip install networkx <br>
2- pip install matplotlib <br><br>

We used the following Python libraries:
<br><br>
1- networkx (for constructing graph network) <br>
2- heapq (for implementing Dijkstra algorithm) <br>
3- random (for generating random weights for the edges) <br>
4- matplotlib (for plotting graphs created using networkx) <br>
5- copy (for the purpose of making deep copies of mutable data types) <br><br>

Along with text outputs for each question, we have additionally included two graph outputs,<br><br>

1- Graph generated from the given sequence (if it is graphical)
2- Graph of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), using Kruskal'sÂ algorithm

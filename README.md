Before running the code, make sure that python libraries- networkx and matplotlib are installed in the system.

It can be installed using the following cmd prompts: <br>
<b> 1- pip install networkx </b> <br>
<b> 2- pip install matplotlib </b> <br><br>
<hr>
The following Python libraries were used:
<br><br>
1- networkx (for constructing graph network) <br>
2- heapq (for implementing Dijkstra algorithm) <br>
3- random (for generating random weights for the edges) <br>
4- matplotlib (for plotting graphs created using networkx) <br>
5- copy (for the purpose of making deep copies of mutable data types) <br><br>
<hr>
Along with text outputs for each question, two graph outputs are additionally included: <br>
1- Graph network generated from the given sequence (if it is graphical) <br>
2- Graph of Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), using Kruskal's algorithm <br>
<br>
<b>Problem Statement or Questions for the project:</b>
<br><br>
1. Write a program that takes a random (graphic) sequence as input and draws the
corresponding graph using Havel-Hakimi algorithm. <br><br>

2. The program also tests whether the graph is Euler graph or not. If yes, implement
Fleury’s algorithm to find an Euler path/circuit for this graph. <br><br>

3. Assign random weights to the edges of this graph. Take a random vertex as input and find
the single source all destination shortest path from this vertex for this graph
implementing Dijkstra’s/Bellman Ford’s algorithm. <br><br>

4. Find the minimum spanning tree of this weighted graph implementing Prim’s/Kruskal’s
algorithm. Find the fundamental cutsets and fundamental circuits of the graph with
respect to this minimum spanning tree. <br><br>

5. Find the edge connectivity and vertex connectivity of this graph. Find the value of K for
which the graph is K-connected.
